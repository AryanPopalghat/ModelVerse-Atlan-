            description: "Google Gemini is a family of large language models, announced in December 2023, that stands as the successor to previous models like LaMDA and PaLM 2. Developed by Google DeepMind, it comes in three sizes: Ultra, Pro, and Nano, catering to different needs, from complex tasks requiring the most powerful Ultra model to efficient on-device tasks handled by the Nano model. Gemini is known for its ability to understand and work with various information formats, including text, code, audio, images, and video, making it a multimodal language model. This versatility has positioned it as a competitor to OpenAI's GPT-4 model. While an experimental mobile app using the technology exists, its capabilities are still under development. Overall, Google Gemini represents a significant step forward in Google's AI research, offering a powerful and versatile language model with various potential applications.",

# AI Models Showcase

## Overview

AI Models Showcase is a web application designed to present a variety of Artificial Intelligence models. It serves as a platform for users to explore different AI capabilities, such as image captioning, text generation, super-resolution, object detection, and more. The application features a collection of models, each with a detailed view where users can learn more and interact with the AI.

## Technology Stack

This project is built using the React framework. Major packages include:

- `axios` for making HTTP requests
- `styled-components` for styling
- `react-router-dom` for navigation

## Performance

Page load time is a crucial factor for user experience. We measured the load time using Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, which provides a detailed report of performance metrics.

## Optimizations

To enhance performance, the following optimizations were implemented:

- **Lazy Loading:** Components are lazy-loaded to reduce the initial load time.
- **Compression:** Assets are compressed to decrease the size of the files transferred.
- **Caching:** Implemented caching strategies for API responses to reduce server hits.
- **Debouncing:** Debounced API calls in search functionalities to limit the number of requests.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
